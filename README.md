# Rain-Prediction-Australia
This is a notebook where i had studied the Rain Dataset of Australia. Main aim was to explore the dataset and try the predict the probability of rainfall using different machine learning algorithms 

<br>
Here I had studied the dataset , which is present in [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package). It isBy which a classification problem where based on many geographical parameters, finally had to predict whether the rain occurs in australia on a day or not. The main challenge here it was a imbalanced dataset whether the propotion of true classes were very less than propotion of No classes. So i had done a oversampling method where minor class (Yes) is oversampled , this is only done in train dataset.

Here i had taken recall, precision as the metric for comparing the different ML algorithms. 

From the study i was able to find that Logistic Regression, Adaboost classifier were able give better and balanced results in terms of precision and recall.
